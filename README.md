# Hospital-Management
Hospital management database system was made that would keep a record of the patients, doctors and staff. Apart from that it keeps the data of the in/out patients alongwith their medical history.
* It keeps the records of the number of vacant wards/beds, medicines, tests, and operations.
* Keeps records of out-patients, their appointments with doctors, lab tests etc.
* Keeps records of the employees viz doctors, nurses, lab assistants, ward boys, security etc
* Keeps a stock of the medicines, tests and operations performed and their respective charges in the hospital.
* During the discharge, it will generate a bill that includes all the services like food, stay, tests and operations(if any). The system also keeps a track of the multiple tenure of patients spent in the hospital over a lng period of time.
